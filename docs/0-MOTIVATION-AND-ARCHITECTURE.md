# Motivation and Architecture

This document aims to answer the following questions.

1. What problem is the product aimed at solving?
2. Who is the product geared towards (targeted audience)?
3. How is the product unique?

A high-level architecture diagram is also attached.

## Problem

A population that is under economic pressure will display distress at the margins first.
My hypothesis is that luxury goods (opposite of Giffen goods) will exhibit a decline in demand and price before widespread economic pressures are realized.

This project will track the price of a specific commodity class, along with inflation figures and macroeconomic measures.
We will specifically target the United States, to minimize requirements for understanding worldwide tax regulations, import requirements, etc...

## Target Audience

The immediate users for this project are boat brokers, owners and prospective buyers; a long-term view of pricing trends is valuable to those people.
As our analysis becomes more robust, eventual audience members might include financial analysts, economic researchers, and other marine industry stakeholders. 

## Unique Value

This is a niche focus product, with special value to adjacent industries. It offers a platform for running analyses over a single set of goods with broad implications.
A similar dataset for real estate is used across the financial industry. Our niche is smaller, which brings advantages for this cohort of the population.
It could also offer an early warning functionality for players in the marine market, or for other luxury good market makers.
